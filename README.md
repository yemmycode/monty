# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## Description

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on implementing the concepts of stacks and queues in the C programming language. The project emphasizes understanding the Last In, First Out (LIFO) and First In, First Out (FIFO) principles, commonly used in data structures.

The main objective of the project is to create a program that can perform various operations on stacks and queues, such as pushing elements onto a stack, popping elements from a stack, enqueueing elements into a queue, and dequeuing elements from a queue. Additionally, the project involves implementing functionalities like checking if a given sequence of commands is valid for performing operations on stacks and queues.

## Project Files

* `monty.c`: The main source file containing the implementation of the stack and queue operations.
* `monty.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and necessary macros.
* `Makefile`: Makefile for compiling the project.

## Usage

To compile the project, run the following command:

```bash
make
